# Welcome to Rockstar Movies

This project was created with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

Make sure you have the current version of Node installed on your machine.

### Attention!

First of all, you need to create an account on [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and generate your API KEY.

When you're done ...

## Follow the steps

Clone the repository on your local machine:

##### `git clone https://github.com/renantorres07/rockstar_movies`

In `api-key.ts`, replace `your_api_key_here` with the api generated in TMDb:

```
 export const key = 'your_api_key_here'
```

Go back to the project's root directory on terminal and install the dependencies with the following commands

##### `yarn install`

or

##### `npm install`

After installing the dependencies, run the following command on terminal to launch the application:

##### `yarn start`

or

##### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser and... enjoy the app!

To deploy your app, run the following command line on terminal

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
